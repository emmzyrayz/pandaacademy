    content: `
Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building production-ready applications. This comprehensive guide will walk you through advanced techniques to leverage Next.js effectively.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js simplifies server-side rendering with the getServerSideProps function:

\`\`\`typescript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetchData(context.params.id);
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
\`\`\`

This approach ensures your page has the latest data on every request, making it ideal for dynamic content.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

For content that doesn't change frequently, static generation provides excellent performance:

\`\`\`typescript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts();
  return {
    props: { posts },
    revalidate: 3600 // Regenerate page every hour
  }
}
\`\`\`

## API Routes

Next.js allows you to build your API within the same project:

\`\`\`typescript
// pages/api/user.ts
export default function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    // Handle POST request
  } else {
    // Handle other methods
  }
}
\`\`\`

This approach simplifies your architecture by keeping frontend and backend code together.

## Image Optimization

The Next.js Image component automatically optimizes images for performance:

\`\`\`typescript
import Image from 'next/image'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/profile.jpg"
      width={500}
      height={300}
      alt="Profile picture"
    />
  )
}
\`\`\`

By implementing these techniques, you'll be able to build highly performant, scalable applications with Next.js.

    content: `
As we progress through 2024, several key trends are reshaping the landscape of web development. Understanding these trends is crucial for developers looking to stay ahead of the curve.

## AI Integration in Web Applications

Artificial intelligence is no longer just a buzzwordâ€”it's becoming an integral part of web applications. From smart content recommendations to natural language interfaces, AI is enhancing user experiences in unprecedented ways.

## WebAssembly Evolution

WebAssembly (Wasm) continues to gain traction, allowing developers to run high-performance code in the browser. This technology is enabling more complex applications to run efficiently on the web, from video editing tools to advanced data visualization.

## Edge Computing

The shift toward edge computing is transforming how web applications are deployed and scaled. By processing data closer to where it's needed, edge computing reduces latency and improves performance.

## CSS Container Queries

Container queries represent a significant advancement in responsive design, allowing elements to adapt based on their parent container rather than just the viewport. This enables more flexible and maintainable component-based designs.

## HTTP/3 and QUIC

The adoption of HTTP/3 and QUIC protocols is improving web performance, particularly for users on unreliable networks. These technologies reduce connection setup times and provide better handling of packet loss.

## Sustainability in Web Development

Environmental considerations are increasingly influencing web development practices. From optimizing for energy efficiency to reducing data transfer, sustainable web development is becoming a priority.

By embracing these trends, developers can create more powerful, efficient, and user-friendly web experiences in 2024 and beyond.

    authorId: 3,
    tags: ["TypeScript", "Programming", "Best Practices"],
   content: `
TypeScript has transformed how developers write and maintain JavaScript code. Here are best practices to help you write cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript code.

## Leverage Type Inference

While TypeScript allows explicit type annotations, it's often better to let the compiler infer types when possible:

\`\`\`typescript
// Instead of this:
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

// Do this:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // TypeScript infers number[]
\`\`\`

This reduces verbosity while maintaining type safety.

## Use Interfaces for Object Shapes

Interfaces provide a clear way to define object shapes:

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  active?: boolean; // Optional property
}

function getUserInfo(user: User) {
  // Implementation
}
\`\`\`

## Discriminated Unions for Complex Types

When dealing with related types that differ in structure, use discriminated unions:

\`\`\`typescript
interface Success {
  status: 'success';
  data: string[];
}

interface Error {
  status: 'error';
  message: string;
}

type ApiResponse = Success | Error;

function handleResponse(response: ApiResponse) {
  if (response.status === 'success') {
    // TypeScript knows we have a Success type
    console.log(response.data.length);
  } else {
    // TypeScript knows we have an Error type
    console.error(response.message);
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Readonly Modifiers for Immutability

Use \\\`readonly\\\` to enforce immutability:

\`\`\`typescript
interface Config {
  readonly apiKey: string;
  readonly endpoint: string;
}

const config: Config = {
  apiKey: 'abc123',
  endpoint: '/api/v1'
};

// This would cause a TypeScript error:
// config.apiKey = 'new-key';
\`\`\`

## Strict Null Checks

Enable \\\`strictNullChecks\\\` in your tsconfig.json to catch potential null or undefined values:

\`\`\`typescript
function getLength(text: string | null) {
  // This would error with strictNullChecks enabled
  // return text.length;
  
  // Do this instead:
  return text ? text.length : 0;
}
\`\`\`

By following these practices, you'll write more maintainable, bug-resistant TypeScript code that scales well as your project grows.
